# Description

Diary is a little python program, written by me (**@benaryorg**).

It is a web-application, to store your personal diary in an easy way!

## Development

I currently do not have much time to develop this program, but I would
like to use it by myself, so I will put most of my time in it.


Please report bugs or tell me what features you would like to see soon.

## Branches

There will be two branches.

### stable

The stable version, where **all** bugfixes directly go to.

### testing

The branch used for development. It will be mostly stable, but there will be
some things like a logout button on the login page.

You should use this one, if you want functionality! Use it with `git checkout testing`!

## Concept

It's concept is easy. You have a database where everything is stored.

There you have a table `users` with all your users and passwords (hashed).

The table `diaries` is to store your different diaries,
for example you could have one diary for writing about school,
one for writing about yourself, one for your boy/girlfriend and so on.
Here is also stored, if the diary is **public** (blog-like), **private**
(for yourself) or **protected** (only chosen poeple have access).

The table `entries` stores your diary entries.

## Technical Details

Diary is written in _python2.7_ and is using _flask_, _bcrypt_ and _sqlalchemy_!
